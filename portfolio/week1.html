            What did I do since the last meeting? <p>I have not started meeting
            yet. This is the first week of the semester. I am pretty much sure
            that if I had meet with my team, the week assignment would have been
            made easier to understand.</p>
          </p>
          2. What am I going to do next? <p>I will keep trying to work on
          understanding this week assignment especially with the GitHub setup.
          Yes, I did create a portfolio, but the file I created on my VC still
          can’t be stored on my portfolio. I’ll also try to reach out.</p> 3. What
          are my blockers? <p>Comprehending the assignment on portfolio building
          was my blocker. Installing GitHub was another challenge. I feel the
          team meeting with help make things easier to understand.</p>
